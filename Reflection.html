    <h1>What does it take to trust someone</h1>
    <img src="images/Trust.png" alt="trust-img">
    <h2>Today in leadership we discussed what it takes to trust someone and what trust is. For me to trust someone, it takes time and experience. Trust to me means that the person is there for you and you can rely on them to do something for you.</h2>

    <h1>Intro to Computer Systems</h1>
    <img src="images/module 3.png" alt="module3-img">
    <h2>In module 3 we talked about the physical element of a computer(hardware) and the thing that controls hardware and tells it what to do(software). We also talked about the difference between external hardware(Ex: Monitor, Mic, Webcam) vs internal hardware(Ex: CPU, RAM, BIOS). Another thing we talked about is the process cycle(input, output, storage, process) which is a process that every computer goes through in order to take information in and give it back in a way the user understands.</h2>

    <h2>On the first week of entrepreneurship we did this thing called a community walk. A community walk is where you walk around your community and look for problems that you can solve like: homelessness, potholes, etc. After the walk we shared our ideas in a group on how to fix these problems.</h2>

    <h1>Intro to Computational Thinking</h1>
    <img src="images/module 2.png" alt="mod2-img">
    <h2>In module 2 we dove into computational thinking, which is taking a complex problem, understanding it, and solving it. We discussed the 4 components of computational thinking: Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Algorithm Design. I believe computational thinking is essential to master in computer science because it is a skill used to understand what to say to a computer.</h2>

    <h2>In module 4 we discussed what is inside of an operating system like: Windows, Mac OSx, and Linux, though we mainly focused on Mac OSx. We also discussed bit system, which is a system that measures the size of digital information. Another thing we discussed were application systems(apps) which software programs that do specific tasks.</h2>
